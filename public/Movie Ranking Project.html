<h1>The best movies according to me</h1>
<h2>My top 3 movies of all time</h2>
<p>Almost all of them are anime by the way,<br /> 
   because when I was fifteen I got carried<br /> 
   away by their art and in combination with<br />
   my puberty, thay were hitting a lot of<br />
   softspots in my psyche.</p>
<hr />
<h3>Swort Art Online</h3>

<p>It is copromised from 7 seasons<br />
   with the first two of them being<br />
   my favorite. I have no words for<br /> 
   this. It's the best.</p>
<h3>Re-Write</h3>

<p>It has 3 seasons and it's kind of<br />
   weird at the start, but it gets<br />
   better and better as it goes on,<br />
   with a dramatic plot twist at the<br />
   end.</p>
<h3>Charlotte</h3>

<p>A two seasoned anime, that you have<br />
   to have patience. It is so bad at the<br />
   start that a lot of my friends stoped<br />
   watching it. I will say three words,<br />
   OP protagonist that steal other's<br />
   abilities. Go watch the rest and<br />
   conclusion is yours to be made</p>
